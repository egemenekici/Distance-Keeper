# DistanceKeeper

It is a life facilitator android application that is using the bluetooth feature of mobile devices and with the bluetooth signals emitted by the beacon device which offers BLE technology usage, it provides user to see the content carried by the device. With this content, the user gains the ability to see the customer occupancy rate, menu, and campaigns of that shop (for example: restaurant) without getting too close to the shop where this beacon device is used. With this situation, it is aimed to help to normalize life for both the customer and the shopkeeper by ensuring that the customer abides by the social distance rules as much as possible.

This project was created in cooperation with Android Studio and Visual Studio Code. Application part of the project is written in Java language. Restful API was built by Node.js Express and MongoDB and written in JavaScript. The data contained in the MongoDB Atlas database was created and organized in JSON format. After the server design and restoring database were finished, the local server deployed with Heroku.
